    <p>Hackathons are a great way to meet with other people who share similar interests as you. Basically, you go to a venue, and have 24 hours to create something cool to solve a problem. Hackathons are really fun because it gives you experience creating something, but also allows you to meet new people who you can talk to about programming.</p>
    
<p>To me, a huge part of the hackathon experience is going with a team. Ideally, you want a balanced team of 3 people. One for hardware, software, and designing and frontend. It can also just be friends, bause you can always pick up new skills at the hackathon and split work.
