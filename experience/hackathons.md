    <p>Hackathons are a great way to meet with other people who share similar interests as you. Basically, you go to a venue, and have 24 hours to create something cool to solve a problem. Hackathons are really fun because it gives you experience creating something, but also allows you to meet new people who you can talk to about programming.</p>
    
<p>To me, a huge part of the hackathon experience is going with a team. Ideally, you want a balanced team of 3 people. One for hardware, software, and designing and frontend. It can also just be friends, because you can always pick up new skills at the hackathon and split work.</p>


### How can I Maximize My Chances of Winning
<p>If you are going to a hackathon with the aim of winning, or placing, you want to be as prepared as possible. This means installing as many packages as you think you need, planning out a project idea and having a basic idea of how you will implement it. Installing important packages beforehand saves so much valuable time, because from experience, you are bound to get some installation errors that will frustrate you a lot.</p>

<p>Also, work on a great demo and presentation. Make sure you connect your ideas with judges well in order for them to understand what you have made. A lot of people underestimate the power of a good demonstration and presentation. </p>

### What Are Some Hackathon Project Ideas?
<p>A lot of hackathon project ideas come from the question "What important/big problem can I solve that I know exists?". It doesn't necessarily have to be "Global Warming" or "Cancer", but even tiny things like some hardware that can help the blind. As long as your solution is faily novel, and addresses a problem that you think is important, it is a good project.</p>
